Today will be the 18 month aniversary of my joining the startup within a
research organisation known as [Red Lizard Software](http://redlizards.com/).
One notable achievement is that I have been so busy working that I have failed
to write any copy about myself on the companies Team page. This situation also
happened at my previous work place, and I still have not written my bio for the
[Yesod Contributors](http://www.yesodweb.com/page/contributors/) page. An honour
I was asked to do after submitting only one patch.
