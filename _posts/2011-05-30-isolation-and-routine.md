title: isolation and routine

  The internet went out for a night so I decided to write a blog and create some
  useful content for the world.

Our internet went out last night. Right in the middle of trying to figure out
what the safe argument does with jekyll. I was navigating around the [jekyll][]
repository on [github][] when suddenly our modem stopped being connected to the
internet. This was followed by a few futile attempts to get it the modem to
connect to the ISP.

So we spent the night wrapped in a cold blanket of isolation from the world.
It was this isolation that revealed to me the addiction I have been living with
for the past few months. My morning and night time routine consisted of loading
up [Hacker News][], [Reddit][], and my [Google Reader][] and clicking anything
that was remotely interesting. This included any F7U12 comics, amusing pictures,
or news about what innovations AMD and Intel are releasing in the next 6-8
months.

Since my routine was shaken up last night and this morning (fixed after a rather
long phone call) I have cleaned up the apartment and become motivated enough to
fix up my domain and actually post some content (even though I am writing this while
the internet is working). I also intend to post some experiments with
[KnockoutJS][] on here in the near future. I still have not completely figured
out the navigation or the complete layout yet but so far it is looking nice
enough.

Unfortunately it seems that in order to shake things up and go from being a
passive consumer to an active producer I need to shut down my internet for 24 hours.
This sounds like it is related to what I know about focus. Remove distractions and
you can gain focus easier.
