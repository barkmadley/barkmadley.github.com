title: philosophy of web development

---

problem with web development.

multiple language contexts.

not enough abstraction.

too many library based frameworks.

not enough code generation.

node.js is in the right direction since you can run the same code server/client.

most of a web programmers job is glue code.

glue between:

* model to controller
* controller to view
* view to html
* html to js
* js to ui
* potentially the reverse of each of these

generating code can target any framework.
