problem with web development.

I find that in modern web development, we (programmers) tend to write a lot of
glue code. Sometimes this glue code is hidden away in the form of libraries, but
usually what we tend to end up doing is writing code that connects two isolated
pieces of code together in away that Gets The Task Done<sup>tm</sup>.

multiple language contexts.

Not only do we usually write glue code, we have to do it in multiple languages
and also across these language boundaries.

example ORMs vs SQL.

not enough abstraction.

too many library based frameworks.

not enough code generation.

node.js is in the right direction since you can run the same code server/client.

most of a web programmers job is glue code.

glue between:

* model to controller
* controller to view
* view to html
* html to js
* js to ui
* potentially the reverse of each of these

generating code can target any framework.
