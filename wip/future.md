title: future posts with jekyll
---

Since I created a jekyll based website that will contain all my future postings
I started thinking about how I would handle the scenario whereby I would like to
write now, but publish later. This capability would allow me to queue up some
great posts quickly, but spread out the publishing time to make it look like I
have been writing on a consistent timeline. While this may be similar to lying,
I think that at the very least it would be an intellectual exercise to come up
with a capable scheme to accomplish this goal.
