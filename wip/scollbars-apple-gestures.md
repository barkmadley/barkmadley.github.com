title: scrollbars, apple gestures etc

I was recently looking over a gist someone had posted when I noticed I had
become annoyed at the placement of the scrollbar along the bottom of the code
snippet. While browsing the middle of the code, the interaction of the overflow
of the text area, along with the long nature of the code made it extremely
difficult to read and understand what is going on.

edit screen shot with scroll bar moved to permanent position.

mention gestures and how they elegantly solve this problem, but also mention
that they don't immediately show which elements on the page need or can be
scrolled.
